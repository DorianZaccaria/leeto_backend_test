# Leeto Full Stack Engineer Test

> First of all, many thanks for applying at Leeto ðŸ™‚

## Context 
Leeto aims at helping work councils - CSE - to create and manage perks for an organisation's employee.
The test aims at delivering a simple implementation of one type of perks: the subsidy.

A subsidy works as follow: 
* The work council sets up a new perk in its own back-office
  * The perk should have be defined over a period
  * The perk should a have a maximum amount
  * The perks can implement some rules applying on employees' eligibilities
* An employee makes a reimbursement request regarding a perk
  * The employee needs to access the list of the perks s.he is eligible to
  * The employee should be able to access a particular perk
  * The employee can make the reimbursement request by:
    * Specifying the amount s.he want to be reimbursed
    * Adding a receipt/proof of payment

## Requirements
You should implement the basic mechanism of the subsidy by extending the current app.

### Must Do
* The employees have to be logged-in to be using the app
* Employees can not ask to be reimbursed for a superior amount than the one specified in the perk's definition
* The app should be deployed on any cloud provider - AWS, GCP, Heroku... -

### How to submit your test
You should spend around 3 hours on this test. 
You can dig deeper and implement more features if you want to, but we will evaluate the quality of the work vs the time spent ont the exercise.

You can submit your work by forking the app, add your code and then open a pull request againt the upstream.

Good Luck!
